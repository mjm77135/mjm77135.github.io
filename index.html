<h2>My Personality</h2>
<p> I have been told that I am a humorous individual who is never particularly serious. However, I do take accountability for my actions and beleve that I am properly serious when it is necessary. My humorous nature comes primarily from my father who likes to  make light of just about any situation regardless of how stressed he himself might be.  I think I am this way because his attitude towards things when I was young made me feel like everything would always be okay.  In my youth, it took me a long time to really come to terms with how it felt when things actually got serious.</p>
<p> It was through my mother  that I developed my sense of accountability.  She is one who made many mistakes in her youth and many of them still hamper certain aspects of her life today.  She isn't someone who gets down about things she can no longer change, but instead she rolls with the punches and just keeps moving on.  Whether it be difficulty in her workplace or even quarrels with my father, I have never seen her linger for too long on any one  problem.  She prioritizes things and doesn't make excuses for her shortcomings.  Thats the aspect of her personality that I think I draw the greatest from. </p>
<p> The blend of my parents stronger characteristics is the personality I see in myself today.  I am not one who dwells on problems for exceptional amounts of time, but instead I can find the humor in situations which I can do nothing about, but will always try to make the best out of any situation that still has any hope of being salvaged. I don't believe in giving up on too many things, but I also am not going to go too far out of my own way to try to change the opinons of someone else or the situation that I am in if it doesn't seem fixable to me at the time.  I see myself as someone who just keeps moving on and enjoys each day as it comes to me. </p>
